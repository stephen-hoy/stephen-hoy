## About Me

I work at the intersection between computational and physical materials chemistry, with my past research including DFT x-ray absorption modelling of superconductor materials for fusion reactors. Now I'm applying machine-learning to quantum mechanics data of glassy solid-state electrolytes, at The Faraday Institution - driving the next big leap in battery technology.
